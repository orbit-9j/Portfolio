Following a tutorial by Grant Abbitt on YouTube, I created a scene of a person looking at a monster in the dark.

As such, I had no idea what implications this tool will have for education and employment in the future. In the bootcamp I learned that AI can take over repetitive tasks so that employees become available to work on things that challenge their creativity and problem solving, which can improve their satisfaction with their job. I was taught that employees who embrace the use of AI will replace those who resist it, and I should make use of it whenever necessary.",

I realised that the number of active followers is more important than the number of total followers because it measures customer engagement with the ad campaign. I learned that shares and user tags/mentions are the most valuable form of engagement because they spread the ad campaign's reach.",

I worked with a coursemate to design a Halloween campaign featuring a mascot based on the TG logo. I redesigned the logo to suit the Halloween theme and asked ChatGPT to name the creature so that its initials match TG.

In a group poll, most people (including me) have voted 'correct' as the most important to them. I voted for it because if the information I am given is incorrect, then no matter what I do with it will be a waste of resources because the final product will need to be scrapped. It reminded me of how ChatGPT sometimes provides incorrect information, which  waste of time to the user and can sread and cause harm.",

I really like Miro because of how easy and straightforward it is to use, and I think it greatly improves my ability to collaborate.

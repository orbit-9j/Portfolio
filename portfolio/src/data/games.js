      "<div class='textContainer'><h2>About the module </h2><p>Design Thinking and Prototyping for User Experience is a module focusing on research methods and peer feedback to teach the design process of any computer system. The module gives the student full freedom to develop any system they wish to, starting with a problem, brainstorming solutions, and prototyping the final design. The module is evaluated through the miro board presentation of the students' research, which includes a Figma prototype.</p></div>    <div class='textContainer'><h2>My approach</h2>    <p>I aimed to create an effective psychological horror game to allow players to explore uncomfortable topics in a safe virtual environment. I chose the psychological horror as I believe it is the best at making an impact on the player because it elicits strong emotions. For a horror game to be effective, I chose to maximise both fear and enjoyment to increase the chances of the player playing the game to the end. During my research, the main topics that participants wanted to explore were war, mental illness, and neurodiversity. With the help of peer feedback, I identified the most necessary features for the players to enjoy the game, such as a variety of game modes to make the game accessible to more sensitive audiences. I made a moodboard of existing psychological horror games to find inspiration for the design of my game, and drew the visuals that aligned with my idea. <p>See miro board or Figma for more details and screenshots of this project.</p></p></div>    <div class='textContainer'><h2>Game description</h2>    <p>The game follows Mortimer, an autistic psychologist working on a mind control drug in a government lab during a war. Due to time pressure, the drug could not be properly tested before releasing it as a gas all around the world. The drug plunged humanity into deep sleep, and Mortimer must travel through different people's dream worlds to find a way to wake them up. Since dreams are the most personal reflections of one's mind, he will come across a variety of bizarre and disturbing imagery on his quest to save the world. As he encounters disturbing monsters, he must manage his sensory overload to survive. He must also face his own demons, which manifest as a Deadline Monster, symbolising the stress and anxiety that comes with his fast-paced and energy-demanding job.</p></div>  <div class='textContainer'><h2>Reflection</h2>    <p>There were 2 aspects of the project that I really enjoyed.</p>    <p>The first aspect was data collection and analysis. I used Microsoft Forms to carry out a survey. I used the built-in MS Forms results summary for quantitative analysis, then performed qualitative analysis through an affinity diagram. I love collecting data and finding patterns in it, that I can then use to create something new.</p>    <p>The second aspect that I liked was creating the game's visuals. I drew the characters, environments, and some UI elements from scratch using Krita. I liked watching the game prototype come together with a coherent colour scheme and art style. It was a challenge to make a game prototype using Figma, which is aimed more towards app and website UI creation, but that only made me feel more satisfied once I wired up all the interactions and made it work.<br> </p></div> ",

Fly above a magic garden, make crow friends, and lead your      murder into a one-sided battle with death itself. Not even the grim      reapers can survive the never-ending blasts of bird shit -- assert      dominance over mortality!    </p>    <p>      This singleplayer game was made for a 5-hour game jam hosted by      CyberSoc in collaboration with my sister and with the help of free      pizza. This is a top-down 2-D shooter game where you are a crow who      poops on grim reapers using the space button to evade your own demise.      When in proximity of a sitting crow, the crow is added to your murder,      increasing your poop firepower. A kill counter is incremented with      every reaper death. Currently there is no win condition and only one      level due to the limited time I had to develop this game.    </p>    </div><div class='textContainer'><h2>Credits</h2>    <ul>      <li>nast: character art</li>      <li>Cainos on itch.io: tileset</li>      <li>ansimuz on itch.io: menu background</li>      <li>mounirtohami on itch.io: menu buttons</li>    </ul></div>",

When Mortimer accidentally installs a trojan program posing as and illegal copy of a video game, their video game console is freed from internet-wide robot mind control. The console guides them through cybersecurity concepts as they explore the villain’s catgirl lab, and helps defeat Long Dusk, the multi-billionaire who became the president of the world. The victory frees enslaved alien robots from mind control and allows them to go back to their home planet, ending a 10-year-long space war and allowing the citizens of Subterropolis to emerge from the underground.",

The survey assessed the game's enjoyment and effectiveness at teaching cybersecurity.

Because I aimed to create a complete game, I had plenty of practice with the Unity 2D game engine and the C# programming language, making me less reliant on online tutorials.",
        "I really enjoyed working with the game assets. While most of the assets were taken from itch.io, I had to modify some of them to change their colour to fit with the game's purple and yellow theme. I also drew some character sprites and all of their portraits using Krita. The characters are inspired by my friends who expressed interest in becoming part of the story.",
        "I also had fun creating the game world and adding flavourtext. I wanted my world to fit into the uncanny valley, with weird and bizarre elements present in an otherwise ordinary and familiar setting to reflect the strangeness of the game's story. I wanted to make a game that doesn't take itself seriously, so I added a character that breaks the fourth wall and points out the strangeness of the world that the other characters fail to notice. I believe that gamifying a concept is only one half of making it enjoyable, and the other half requires the players to connect with the game world and the characters.",
        "This is the biggest scope game I have ever made, and the only game I fully completed. I am very proud of how it turned out.",
        "One thing I'm really disappointed about however is that I couldn't finish my final report. I gave myself a week to write it, and at the end reached around 17k words. However, this was not enough to fully explain many aspects of this project and I left several sections only partially written. As the report was the only part of the project marked (the code did not count at all), I believe that my grade could have been much higher if I had given myself more time to finish the report.",

There are several features that I want to add or fix before I am fully happy with the game. I plan to upload the game to itch.io after implementing the changes suggested during user testing. ",
        "I ran into an issue when building the game, where collisions and some scripts were not working correctly in the build but worked fine in the Unity game window. This limited the extend of user testing I could do because I had to invite users to play the game directly on my machine from the Unity window.",

I chose the psychological horror genre as I believe it is the best at making an impact on the player because it elicits strong emotions. For a horror game to be effective, I chose to maximise both fear and enjoyment to increase the chances of the player playing the game to the end. During my research, the main topics that participants wanted to explore were war, mental illness, and neurodiversity. With the help of peer feedback, I identified the most necessary features for the players to enjoy the game, such as a variety of game modes to make the game accessible to more sensitive audiences. I made a moodboard of existing psychological horror games to find inspiration for the design of my game, and drew the visuals that aligned with my idea.",

Due to time pressure, the drug could not be properly tested before releasing it as a gas all around the world. The drug plunged humanity into deep sleep, and Mortimer must travel through different people's dream worlds to find a way to wake them up. Since dreams are the most personal reflections of one's mind, he will come across a variety of bizarre and disturbing imagery on his quest to save the world. As he encounters disturbing monsters, he must manage his sensory overload to survive. He must also face his own demons, which manifest as a Deadline Monster, symbolising the stress and anxiety that comes with his fast-paced and energy-demanding job.",

I used the built-in MS Forms results summary for quantitative analysis, then performed qualitative analysis through an affinity diagram. I love collecting data and finding patterns in it, that I can then use to create something new.",
        "The second aspect that I liked was creating the game's visuals. I drew the characters, environments, and some UI elements from scratch using Krita. I liked watching the game prototype come together with a coherent colour scheme and art style. It was a challenge to make a game prototype using Figma, which is aimed more towards app and website UI creation, but that only made me feel more satisfied once I wired up all the interactions and made it work.",

I have added several new characters, including a character from Cyberscape. The plot was changed and overhauled, and I am now in the process of creating concept art for the characters and their nightmare worlds.",

With the freedom to make virtually any game we wanted, we settled for an old-school dungeon crawler game. We interpreted 'social game' to mean a game with multiplayer features and potentially a way for the players to communicate (i.e. chat, which was scrapped due to time constraints). None of us have ever done game development or used a game engine before, so we were overwhelmed by this task. In hindsight, we should have probably thought outside the box and come up with something simpler.",
        "Throughout development we had 2 meetings with frank. In the first meeting we presented our initial ideas and plans for the game. In the second meeting we presented the final game, as well as our reflections. Due to the team's lack of experience with game development and the time constraints, we couldn't include or polish many of the features we planned. Frank gave us feedback on our final presentation, and the thing that stood out to me was that he didn't like that we focused on what could have been. Frank said our final product ticks off his criteria and therefore satisfies him, and we should have spent more time celebrating the few things that we did accomplish. I found this to be a valuable lesson in team morale.",

        "Teamwork and Leadership",
        "Originally, the team had 6 members, one of which was our leader. However, we naturally split into 2 subteams, with one working on the report and presentation, and the other working on the game itself. I believed that the original leader wasn't very good at his position, and our progress was going slowly. I took initiative in the game's development and created the menu and a draft of the map generation. Being the first and only person to develop the game at that time, I took the reigns of the game dev side of the project. I set up a meeting where I explained to the rest of my subteam how the code works so they could jump in and add onto it. Due to the initial disorganisation of the wider team, the 3 of us had to complete as much of the game as possible in an incredibly short time period (we completed the main bulk of it in 3 days, please don't tell Frank). ",
        "From that point on, progress on the game had significantly picked up pace. Working in a smaller team certainly helped, in addition to us naturally taking up roles according to our strengths. I think that if I had taken the initiative sooner, we would have been able to make a lot more progress. Before this project I have never really engaged in leadership, preferring to complete tasks that were assigned to me on my own. Now I know that I have the ability to make a difference in the team and I am looking forward to applying and improving my leadership skills in future projects.",

Fly above a magic garden, make crow friends, and lead your murder into a one-sided battle with death itself. Not even the grim reapers can survive the never-ending blasts of bird poop - assert dominance over mortality!",
        "This singleplayer game was made for a 5-hour game jam hosted by CyberSoc in collaboration with my sister and with the help of free pizza. This is a top-down 2-D shooter game where you are a crow who poops on grim reapers using the space button to evade your own demise. When in proximity of a sitting crow, the crow is added to your murder, increasing your poop firepower. A kill counter is incremented with every reaper death. Currently there is no win condition and only one level due to the limited time I had to develop this game.",

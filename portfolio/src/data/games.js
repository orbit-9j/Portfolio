The console guides them through cybersecurity concepts as they explore the villain’s catgirl lab, and helps defeat Long Dusk, the multi-billionaire who became the president of the world. The victory frees enslaved alien robots from mind control and allows them to go back to their home planet, ending a 10-year-long space war and allowing the citizens of Subterropolis to emerge from the underground.",

Because I aimed to create a complete game, I had plenty of practice with the Unity 2D game engine and the C# programming language, making me less reliant on online tutorials.",
        "I really enjoyed working with the game assets. While most of the assets were taken from itch.io, I had to modify some of them to change their colour to fit with the game's purple and yellow theme. I also drew some character sprites and all of their portraits using Krita. The characters are inspired by my friends who expressed interest in becoming part of the story.",
        "I also had fun creating the game world and adding flavourtext. I wanted my world to fit into the uncanny valley, with weird and bizarre elements present in an otherwise ordinary and familiar setting to reflect the strangeness of the game's story. I wanted to make a game that doesn't take itself seriously, so I added a character that breaks the fourth wall and points out the strangeness of the world that the other characters fail to notice. I believe that gamifying a concept is only one half of making it enjoyable, and the other half requires the players to connect with the game world and the characters.",

I chose the psychological horror genre as I believe it is the best at making an impact on the player because it elicits strong emotions. For a horror game to be effective, I chose to maximise both fear and enjoyment to increase the chances of the player playing the game to the end. During my research, the main topics that participants wanted to explore were war, mental illness, and neurodiversity. With the help of peer feedback, I identified the most necessary features for the players to enjoy the game, such as a variety of game modes to make the game accessible to more sensitive audiences. I made a moodboard of existing psychological horror games to find inspiration for the design of my game, and drew the visuals that aligned with my idea.",

Due to time pressure, the drug could not be properly tested before releasing it as a gas all around the world. The drug plunged humanity into deep sleep, and Mortimer must travel through different people's dream worlds to find a way to wake them up. Since dreams are the most personal reflections of one's mind, he will come across a variety of bizarre and disturbing imagery on his quest to save the world. As he encounters disturbing monsters, he must manage his sensory overload to survive. He must also face his own demons, which manifest as a Deadline Monster, symbolising the stress and anxiety that comes with his fast-paced and energy-demanding job.",

I used the built-in MS Forms results summary for quantitative analysis, then performed qualitative analysis through an affinity diagram. I love collecting data and finding patterns in it, that I can then use to create something new.",
        "The second aspect that I liked was creating the game's visuals. I drew the characters, environments, and some UI elements from scratch using Krita. I liked watching the game prototype come together with a coherent colour scheme and art style. It was a challenge to make a game prototype using Figma, which is aimed more towards app and website UI creation, but that only made me feel more satisfied once I wired up all the interactions and made it work.",

        "Have you ever wondered what it is like to be a crow? Well now you have the answer! Fly above a magic garden, make crow friends, and lead your murder into a one-sided battle with death itself. Not even the grim reapers can survive the never-ending blasts of bird poop - assert dominance over mortality!",
        "This singleplayer game was made for a 5-hour game jam hosted by CyberSoc in collaboration with my sister and with the help of free pizza. This is a top-down 2-D shooter game where you are a crow who poops on grim reapers using the space button to evade your own demise. When in proximity of a sitting crow, the crow is added to your murder, increasing your poop firepower. A kill counter is incremented with every reaper death. Currently there is no win condition and only one level due to the limited time I had to develop this game.",
